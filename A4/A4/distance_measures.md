### your distance measure
Euclidean distance

### your justification
Euclidean distance was chosen because it effectively captures the overall similarity between genres by considering the straight-line distance between word vectors in a multidimensional space. This measure ensures that genres with similar term frequencies and distributions are positioned closer together, providing an intuitive and geometrically meaningful representation of their semanticÂ relationships.
